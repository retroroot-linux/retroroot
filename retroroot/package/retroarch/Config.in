	bool "retroarch"
	help
	  RetroArch is the reference frontend for the libretro API.
	  Popular examples of implementations for this API includes
	  video game system emulators and game engines as well as
	  more generalized 3D programs. These programs are
	  instantiated as dynamic libraries.
	  We refer to these as "libretro cores".
